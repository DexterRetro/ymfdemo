We continue sharing our core competencies by encouraging more participation in meaningful mining projects and capacity building workshops/training on mining enterprise, development and commercialisation. Our system is focused on the specific needs of our membership base and therefore continue creating platforms for our Young Miners Symposiums,Exchangeprogrammes,Conventions,Exhibitions and Seminars, where members can exchange experiences and best mining practises. Our Public Relations team is working all round the clock to upgrade and develop our online interaction platform for the members and other players in the industry.",

Researches done in Silobela,Inyathi,Kadoma and Gokwe(Masoro) areas show that Survey work could be done more effective if we get Exploration devices that ascertain depth, direction and expected returns of main belts such as the VR1000 B-II Long Range King Gold Detector. Prospecting devices also reduce unnecessary land degradation on the environment because Young Miners get to know precisely where to sink their shafts.",

Our organisation shall continue to identify and engage with key partners in the Environmental Protection area.",

We have realised the strategic importance of minerals such as Molybednum,Tantalite and Chrome in Shurugwi andCoal inHwange andGokwe.It is our dream to partner with investors inorder to prospect and exploit such minerals.We forecast on engaging intoMineral Beneficiation projects of these and other minerals inorder to realise full economic value of our mineral resources.",

Our main shaft however, collapsed because of seepage caused by the rains which saw our mining activities at that site winding to a halt.Nevertheless,we got the necessary lessons on the importance of box timbering to fortify our shafts in future and adhering to other essential Occupational and Environmental Health and Safety precautions as stipulated by the provisions of the Environmental Management Agency(EMA) act."

The team discovered that the site is an old German working because of abandoned trenches and an ore milling site less than 100m of the trenches.\nSamples taken from the ore body reveal that the ore can yield a minimum of 10g/tonne or more in the advanced stage of the project. The gold belt has an average width of 30cm which is suitable for commercial exploitation.\n\n(2)Vugwi(Zvishavane)-Gold Reef\n\nThe Vugwi area is approximately 25km along the Zvishavane-Buchwa road. The prospected areas are approximately 15km North West from Vugwi Shopping Centre. Surveys reveal that gold belts in these areas are an extension of the Sabi Mine Commercial gold deposits that are suitable for the development of sustainable mining enterprises.\nSampling results from a 3m deep shaft show that the gold ore yields an average of 5g/tonne. The width of the reef ranges from 15cm-25cm.\n\nThe positive survey results of these areas show them to be suitable for further surveys and mining development that produce exceptional results."
